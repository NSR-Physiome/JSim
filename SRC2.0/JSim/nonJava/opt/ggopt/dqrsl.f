C
C     DQRSL APPLIES THE OUTPUT OF DQRDC TO COMPUTE COORDINATE
C     TRANSFORMATIONS, PROJECTIONS, AND LEAST SQUARES SOLUTIONS.
C     FOR K .LE. MIN(N,P), LET XK BE THE MATRIX
C
C            XK = (X(JPVT(1)),X(JPVT(2)), ... ,X(JPVT(K)))
C
C     FORMED FROM COLUMNNS JPVT(1), ... ,JPVT(K) OF THE ORIGINAL
C     N X P MATRIX X THAT WAS INPUT TO DQRDC (IF NO PIVOTING WAS
C     DONE, XK CONSISTS OF THE FIRST K COLUMNS OF X IN THEIR
C     ORIGINAL ORDER).  DQRDC PRODUCES A FACTORED ORTHOGONAL MATRIX Q
C     AND AN UPPER TRIANGULAR MATRIX R SUCH THAT
C
C              XK = Q * (R)
C                       (0)
C
C     THIS INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN CODED FORM IN THE ARRAYS
C     X AND QRAUX.
C
C     ON ENTRY
C
C        X      DOUBLE PRECISION(LDX,P).
C               X CONTAINS THE OUTPUT OF DQRDC.
C
C        LDX    INTEGER.
C               LDX IS THE LEADING DIMENSION OF THE ARRAY X.
C
C        N      INTEGER.
C               N IS THE NUMBER OF ROWS OF THE MATRIX XK.  IT MUST
C               HAVE THE SAME VALUE AS N IN DQRDC.
C
C        K      INTEGER.
C               K IS THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS OF THE MATRIX XK.  K
C               MUST NNOT BE GREATER THAN MIN(N,P), WHERE P IS THE
C               SAME AS IN THE CALLING SEQUENCE TO DQRDC.
C
C        QRAUX  DOUBLE PRECISION(P).
C               QRAUX CONTAINS THE AUXILIARY OUTPUT FROM DQRDC.
C
C        Y      DOUBLE PRECISION(N)
C               Y CONTAINS AN N-VECTOR THAT IS TO BE MANIPULATED
C               BY DQRSL.
C
C        JOB    INTEGER.
C               JOB SPECIFIES WHAT IS TO BE COMPUTED.  JOB HAS
C               THE DECIMAL EXPANSION ABCDE, WITH THE FOLLOWING
C               MEANING.
C
C                    IF A.NE.0, COMPUTE QY.
C                    IF B,C,D, OR E .NE. 0, COMPUTE QTY.
C                    IF C.NE.0, COMPUTE B.
C                    IF D.NE.0, COMPUTE RSD.
C                    IF E.NE.0, COMPUTE XB.
C
C               NOTE THAT A REQUEST TO COMPUTE B, RSD, OR XB
C               AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGERS THE COMPUTATION OF QTY, FOR
C               WHICH AN ARRAY MUST BE PROVIDED IN THE CALLING
C               SEQUENCE.
C
C     ON RETURN
C
C        QY     DOUBLE PRECISION(N).
C               QY CONNTAINS Q*Y, IF ITS COMPUTATION HAS BEEN
C               REQUESTED.
C
C        QTY    DOUBLE PRECISION(N).
C               QTY CONTAINS TRANS(Q)*Y, IF ITS COMPUTATION HAS
C               BEEN REQUESTED.  HERE TRANS(Q) IS THE
C               TRANSPOSE OF THE MATRIX Q.
C
C        B      DOUBLE PRECISION(K)
C               B CONTAINS THE SOLUTION OF THE LEAST SQUARES PROBLEM
C
C                    MINIMIZE NORM2(Y - XK*B),
C
C               IF ITS COMPUTATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED.  (NOTE THAT
C               IF PIVOTING WAS REQUESTED IN DQRDC, THE J-TH
C               COMPONENT OF B WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH COLUMN JPVT(J)
C               OF THE ORIGINAL MATRIX X THAT WAS INPUT INTO DQRDC.)
C
C        RSD    DOUBLE PRECISION(N).
C               RSD CONTAINS THE LEAST SQUARES RESIDUAL Y - XK*B,
C               IF ITS COMPUTATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED.  RSD IS
C               ALSO THE ORTHOGONAL PROJECTION OF Y ONTO THE
C               ORTHOGONAL COMPLEMENT OF THE COLUMN SPACE OF XK.
C
C        XB     DOUBLE PRECISION(N).
C               XB CONTAINS THE LEAST SQUARES APPROXIMATION XK*B,
C               IF ITS COMPUTATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED.  XB IS ALSO
C               THE ORTHOGONAL PROJECTION OF Y ONTO THE COLUMN SPACE
C               OF X.
C
C        INFO   INTEGER.
C               INFO IS ZERO UNLESS THE COMPUTATION OF B HAS
C               BEEN REQUESTED AND R IS EXACTLY SINGULAR.  IN
C               THIS CASE, INFO IS THE INDEX OF THE FIRST ZERO
C               DIAGONAL ELEMENT OF R AND B IS LEFT UNALTERED.
C
C     THE PARAMETERS QY, QTY, B, RSD, AND XB ARE NOT REFERENCED
C     IF THEIR COMPUTATION IS NOT REQUESTED AND IN THIS CASE
C     CAN BE REPLACED BY DUMMY VARIABLES IN THE CALLING PROGRAM.
C     TO SAVE STORAGE, THE USER MAY IN SOME CASES USE THE SAME
C     ARRAY FOR DIFFERENT PARAMETERS IN THE CALLING SEQUENCE.  A
C     FREQUENTLY OCCURING EXAMPLE IS WHEN ONE WISHES TO COMPUTE
C     ANY OF B, RSD, OR XB AND DOES NOT NEED Y OR QTY.  IN THIS
C     CASE ONE MAY IDENTIFY Y, QTY, AND ONE OF B, RSD, OR XB, WHILE
C     PROVIDING SEPARATE ARRAYS FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS TO BE
C     COMPUTED.  THUS THE CALLING SEQUENCE
C
C          CALL DQRSL(X,LDX,N,K,QRAUX,Y,DUM,Y,B,Y,DUM,110,INFO)
C
C     WILL RESULT IN THE COMPUTATION OF B AND RSD, WITH RSD
C     OVERWRITING Y.  MORE GENERALLY, EACH ITEM IN THE FOLLOWING
C     LIST CONTAINS GROUPS OF PERMISSIBLE IDENTIFICATIONS FOR
C     A SINGLE CALLINNG SEQUENCE.
