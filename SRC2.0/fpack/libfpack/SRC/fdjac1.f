C
C     SUBROUTINE FDJAC1
C
C     THIS SUBROUTINE COMPUTES A FORWARD-DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION
C     TO THE N BY N JACOBIAN MATRIX ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIED
C     PROBLEM OF N FUNCTIONS IN N VARIABLES. IF THE JACOBIAN HAS
C     A BANDED FORM, THEN FUNCTION EVALUATIONS ARE SAVED BY ONLY
C     APPROXIMATING THE NONZERO TERMS.
C
C     THE SUBROUTINE STATEMENT IS
C
C       SUBROUTINE FDJAC1(FCN,N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,IFLAG,ML,MU,EPSFCN,
C                         WA1,WA2)
C
C     WHERE
C
C       FCN IS THE NAME OF THE USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE WHICH
C         CALCULATES THE FUNCTIONS. FCN MUST BE DECLARED
C         IN AN EXTERNAL STATEMENT IN THE USER CALLING
C         PROGRAM, AND SHOULD BE WRITTEN AS FOLLOWS.
C
C         SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)
C         INTEGER N,IFLAG
C         REAL X(N),FVEC(N)
C         ----------
C         CALCULATE THE FUNCTIONS AT X AND
C         RETURN THIS VECTOR IN FVEC.
C         ----------
C         RETURN
C         END
C
C         THE VALUE OF IFLAG SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED BY FCN UNLESS
C         THE USER WANTS TO TERMINATE EXECUTION OF FDJAC1.
C         IN THIS CASE SET IFLAG TO A NEGATIVE INTEGER.
C
C       N IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE SET TO THE NUMBER
C         OF FUNCTIONS AND VARIABLES.
C
C       X IS AN INPUT ARRAY OF LENGTH N.
C
C       FVEC IS AN INPUT ARRAY OF LENGTH N WHICH MUST CONTAIN THE
C         FUNCTIONS EVALUATED AT X.
C
C       FJAC IS AN OUTPUT N BY N ARRAY WHICH CONTAINS THE
C         APPROXIMATION TO THE JACOBIAN MATRIX EVALUATED AT X.
C
C       LDFJAC IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE NOT LESS THAN N
C         WHICH SPECIFIES THE LEADING DIMENSION OF THE ARRAY FJAC.
C
C       IFLAG IS AN INTEGER VARIABLE WHICH CAN BE USED TO TERMINATE
C         THE EXECUTION OF FDJAC1. SEE DESCRIPTION OF FCN.
C
C       ML IS A NONNEGATIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE WHICH SPECIFIES
C         THE NUMBER OF SUBDIAGONALS WITHIN THE BAND OF THE
C         JACOBIAN MATRIX. IF THE JACOBIAN IS NOT BANDED, SET
C         ML TO AT LEAST N - 1.
C
C       EPSFCN IS AN INPUT VARIABLE USED IN DETERMINING A SUITABLE
C         STEP LENGTH FOR THE FORWARD-DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION. THIS
C         APPROXIMATION ASSUMES THAT THE RELATIVE ERRORS IN THE
C         FUNCTIONS ARE OF THE ORDER OF EPSFCN. IF EPSFCN IS LESS
C         THAN THE MACHINE PRECISION, IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE RELATIVE
C         ERRORS IN THE FUNCTIONS ARE OF THE ORDER OF THE MACHINE
C         PRECISION.
C
C       MU IS A NONNEGATIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE WHICH SPECIFIES
C         THE NUMBER OF SUPERDIAGONALS WITHIN THE BAND OF THE
C         JACOBIAN MATRIX. IF THE JACOBIAN IS NOT BANDED, SET
C         MU TO AT LEAST N - 1.
C
C       WA1 AND WA2 ARE WORK ARRAYS OF LENGTH N. IF ML + MU + 1 IS AT
C         LEAST N, THEN THE JACOBIAN IS CONSIDERED DENSE, AND WA2 IS
C         NOT REFERENCED.
