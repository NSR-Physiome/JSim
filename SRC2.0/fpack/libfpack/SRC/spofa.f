      SUBROUTINE SPOFA(A,LDA,N,INFO)
      INTEGER LDA,N,INFO
      REAL A(LDA,*)
C
C     SPOFA FACTORS A REAL SYMMETRIC POSITIVE DEFINITE MATRIX.
C
C     SPOFA IS USUALLY CALLED BY SPOCO, BUT IT CAN BE CALLED
C     DIRECTLY WITH A SAVING IN TIME IF  RCOND  IS NOT NEEDED.
C     (TIME FOR SPOCO) = (1 + 18/N)*(TIME FOR SPOFA) .
C
C     ON ENTRY
C
C        A       REAL(LDA, N)
C                THE SYMMETRIC MATRIX TO BE FACTORED.  ONLY THE
C                DIAGONAL AND UPPER TRIANGLE ARE USED.
C
C        LDA     INTEGER
C                THE LEADING DIMENSION OF THE ARRAY  A .
C
C        N       INTEGER
C                THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX  A .
C
C     ON RETURN
C
C        A       AN UPPER TRIANGULAR MATRIX  R  SO THAT  A = TRANS(R)*R
C                WHERE  TRANS(R)  IS THE TRANSPOSE.
C                THE STRICT LOWER TRIANGLE IS UNALTERED.
C                IF  INFO .NE. 0 , THE FACTORIZATION IS NOT COMPLETE.
C
C        INFO    INTEGER
C                = 0  FOR NORMAL RETURN.
C                = K  SIGNALS AN ERROR CONDITION.  THE LEADING MINOR
C                     OF ORDER  K  IS NOT POSITIVE DEFINITE.
