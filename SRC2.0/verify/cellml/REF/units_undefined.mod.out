 * Macrophage dynamics in diabetic wound dealing
 * 
 * Model Status
 * 
 * This CellML version of the model runs in PCEnv to recreate the
 * results in the published paper. The model has also been checked
 * in COR and the units are consistent. This particular version
 * of the model has alpha set to 0.8 and therefore it represents
 * wound healing in a diabetic patient (figure 2, right hand column).
 * 
 * Model Structure
 * 
 * Wounds in diabetic patients can take much longer to heal than
 * they would in a healthy individual; some taking up to 18 months
 * to heal properly. This suggests the normal wound healing process
 * is disrupted in some way in diabetic patients, but despite intensive
 * research, the mechanisms underlying this process are still relatively
 * poorly understood. However, by piecing together the information
 * which has been obtained, it is possible to develop a simple
 * mathematical model of the wound healing process and how it is
 * influenced by diabetes.
 * 
 * The first stage of the wound healing process is inflammation,
 * and macrophages are some of the first cells to be recruited
 * to the site of injury. They are derived from monocytes and they
 * differentiate into one of three types depending on the chemical
 * stimulus they receive, namely; cytocidal (or killer), inflammatory,
 * and repair macrophages. Killer macrophages remove bacteria and
 * other debris from the wound site by phagocytosis, inflammatory
 * macrophages secrete cytokines and chemokines to attract fibroblasts
 * and endothelial cells to the wound and encourage their proliferation,
 * while repair macrophages help to remodel the extracellular matrix
 * of the wound. The ratio of inflammatory to repair macrophages
 * seems to be a key determinant of the rate of wound healing.
 * 
 * In diabetic patients cell proliferation is often impaired, endothelial
 * cells are more likely to undergo apoptosis, blood glucose levels
 * are elevated, blood vessel growth is impaired, and there can
 * be decreased collagen deposition at the wound site. Macrophage
 * removal to the lymph nodes may also be impaired, which might
 * explain the presence of macrophages at the wound site long after
 * the inflammatory stage when they would have normally been cleared
 * in a healthy individual.
 * 
 * To date, mathematical models of wound healing have tended to
 * focus on the cell proliferation and repair stages of the wound
 * process. However, in diabetic patients it seems the inflammatory
 * phase should be modelled instead. In the paper described here,
 * Helen Waugh and Jonathan Sherratt address this issue by developing
 * a basic mathematical model of the inflammatory stage of the
 * wound healing process, in particular focusing on the behaviour
 * of the macrophage populations. This model is discussed in the
 * context of the available biological data, and simulations are
 * also used to suggest potential treatment strategies.
