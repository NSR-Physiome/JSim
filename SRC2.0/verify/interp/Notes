== AS: new tests for Multilinear and Veldhuizen algs

lin 2 and lin3 - linear tests for two and three dimensions - should
give identical results with all implementations. Tests smoothness and
contiguousness at the borders between intervals. The original points
should be recovered after switching between grids with different delta.

point 2 and point 3: test the behavior of a single node (all other
nodes are set to zero).
The latter two tests give different results for multilinear and
Veldhuizen algorithms. They are here to test the behavior of the
algorithms according to Veldhuizen's thesis, Figure 2.12 and 2.12.
(Note: figure number is missing from Fig. 2.12).
