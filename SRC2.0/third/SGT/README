== 2013/11/21 EB

Collection.java modified: old version used enum as field name which
  is now a java keyword.
  
Added boolean NSRLogScale property so axis title (label) positions
correctly.

== 2005/05/20 EB

Added javac overrides so can build using Sun's JDK
  even though Linux-distriuted ant uses gcj
  which (as of this date) is missing some needed classes (e.g. java.beans.XMLDecoder)

Building SGT for JSim on Linux:
  make sure javac is in /usr/local/jdk
    if not,  modify ./build_sgt.xml accordingly
  download SGT source from Denbo's site to $SGTDIR
    last time used $HOME/SERVER/SGT
  ./sgtcopy $SGTDIR
     which copies mods from this directory into source
  cd $SGTDIR
  ant -f build_sgt.xml
     overrides
     builds sgt_v30.jar in $SGTDIR
  copy sgt_v30.jar as appropriate into $JSIMSRC, e.g.
     cp jars/sgt_v30.jar $JSIMSRC/third/client/sgt_v30nsr.jar

== 2004/10/01

$JSIMSRC/home/ext/sgt_v30.jar was built from David Denbo's SGT v30
source distribution with the modified files listed below.  This
original versions of these files (from Denbo) are in the ORIG directory.

build_sgt.xml           A locally modified version of the ant build file
                            shipped with sgt_src_v30.jar.  To use, check 
                            that you have a working version of Ant (the 
                            version shipped with, e.g., RHEL WS/ES, was 
                            broken), make sure JSIMSRC is defined in your
                            environment, then run "ant -f build_sgt.xml"
                            while at a prompt in the directory above the 
                            "src" directory created by unpacking the 
                            sgt_src_v30.jar file.


PlainAxis.java          from

System.getProperty() or .getProperties() calls.  Uncaught these exceptions
