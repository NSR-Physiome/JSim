  This directory contains Java archives (.jar files) 
that are distributed with JSim,  but were created by 
programmers external to NSR.  It is our belief that the
licensing of each of these products permits their distribution
with JSim.  If you think otherwise,  please contact
librarian@nsr.bioeng.washington.edu.

== xercesImpl.jar, xmlParserAPIs.jar

  These files implement the Xerces XML parser and DOM 
implementation distributed by apache.org. 

  Version unknown, downloaded Jan 2003.

== cup_and_jlex.jar, java-cup-runtime.jar

  The first file contains the complete Java Cup parser 
generator and JLex lexical analyzer generator used when
compiling JSim.  The second contains the portion
of Java Cup required at run-time.  

  JLex version 1.2 - Mar 31 2000.
  CUP version v0.10j - Jul 23 1999.

== jc.jar

  This file contains the Java compiler used to compile 
.java code at model build time.  It is distributed with 
Sun's SDK,  but not with the JRE.  Since JSim distributes 
only the JRE,  jc.jar is included here.  See www.sun.com.

  Version unknown.  Should be tied to the JRE distributed 
with JSim.

== Jama-1.0.1.jar

  This file contains the JAMA matrix package.  See 
http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/

  Version 1.0.1.

== sgt_v30nsr.jar

  This jar contains a locally modified version of the 
Scientific Graphics Toolkit (SGT) used for plotting in 
the JSim package.  See http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/sgt/
The unmodified SGT version was released 2003/09/19 23:14:24.
Local mods may be found in $JSIMSRC/third/SGT.

== AppleJavaExtensions.jar 

  A non-functional placeholder for
Mac application hooks to OSX.  This exists only to allow
$JSIMSRC/JSim/gui classes to compile and load successfully.
On MacOS,  the embedded java versions of these classes are found
before the empty placeholders,  so that the required functionality 
is present.

== BrowserLauncher.jar

  This jar, originally BrowserLauncher2-all-1_3.jar, is a backup
for Desktop browser connections in the JSim GUI.  Downloaded 17 Jul
2012, at which time Java's built-in Desktop.browse(URL) didn't work
on some Linux desktops.
