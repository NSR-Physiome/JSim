 * Model Status
 * 
 * This CellML model represents the "Baseline Model" in the published
 * paper. The model runs in PCEnv and has been unit checked. All
 * the units are balanced. Note that this model will not run in
 * COR due to the presence of a "remainder" function. Note there
 * are no figures in the paper showing the simuation results of
 * this model. However we can say that the simulation output from
 * the CellML model looks reasonable - the body temperature and
 * metabolic rates have physiologically realistic values and oscillate
 * over a 24 hour period according to day and night changes.

 * Model Structure
 * 
 * ABSTRACT: PURPOSE: To describe the pharmacodynamic effects of
 * recombinant human interleukin-21 (IL-21) on core body temperature
 * in cynomolgus monkeys using basic mechanisms of heat regulation.
 * A major effort was devoted to compare the use of ordinary differential
 * equations (ODEs) with stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
 * in pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modelling. METHODS:
 * A temperature model was formulated including circadian rhythm,
 * metabolism, heat loss, and a thermoregulatory set-point. This
 * model was formulated as a mixed-effects model based on SDEs
 * using NONMEM. RESULTS: The effects of IL-21 were on the set-point
 * and the circadian rhythm of metabolism. The model was able to
 * describe a complex set of IL-21 induced phenomena, including
 * 1) disappearance of the circadian rhythm, 2) no effect after
 * first dose, and 3) high variability after second dose. SDEs
 * provided a more realistic description with improved simulation
 * properties, and further changed the model into one that could
 * not be falsified by the autocorrelation function. CONCLUSIONS:
 * The IL-21 induced effects on thermoregulation in cynomolgus
 * monkeys are explained by a biologically plausible model. The
 * quality of the model was improved by the use of SDEs.
