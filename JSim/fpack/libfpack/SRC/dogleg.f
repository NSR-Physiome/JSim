C     SUBROUTINE DOGLEG
C
C     GIVEN AN M BY N MATRIX A, AN N BY N NONSINGULAR DIAGONAL
C     MATRIX D, AN M-VECTOR B, AND A POSITIVE NUMBER DELTA, THE
C     PROBLEM IS TO DETERMINE THE CONVEX COMBINATION X OF THE
C     GAUSS-NEWTON AND SCALED GRADIENT DIRECTIONS THAT MINIMIZES
C     (A*X - B) IN THE LEAST SQUARES SENSE, SUBJECT TO THE
C     RESTRICTION THAT THE EUCLIDEAN NORM OF D*X BE AT MOST DELTA.
C
C     THIS SUBROUTINE COMPLETES THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM
C     IF IT IS PROVIDED WITH THE NECESSARY INFORMATION FROM THE
C     QR FACTORIZATION OF A. THAT IS, IF A = Q*R, WHERE Q HAS
C     ORTHOGONAL COLUMNS AND R IS AN UPPER TRIANGULAR MATRIX,
C     THEN DOGLEG EXPECTS THE FULL UPPER TRIANGLE OF R AND
C     THE FIRST N COMPONENTS OF (Q TRANSPOSE)*B.
C
C     THE SUBROUTINE STATEMENT IS
C
C       SUBROUTINE DOGLEG(N,R,LR,DIAG,QTB,DELTA,X,WA1,WA2)
C
C     WHERE
C
C       N IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE SET TO THE ORDER OF R.
C
C       R IS AN INPUT ARRAY OF LENGTH LR WHICH MUST CONTAIN THE UPPER
C         TRIANGULAR MATRIX R STORED BY ROWS.
C
C       LR IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE NOT LESS THAN
C         (N*(N+1))/2.
C
C       DIAG IS AN INPUT ARRAY OF LENGTH N WHICH MUST CONTAIN THE
C         DIAGONAL ELEMENTS OF THE MATRIX D.
C
C       QTB IS AN INPUT ARRAY OF LENGTH N WHICH MUST CONTAIN THE FIRST
C         N ELEMENTS OF THE VECTOR (Q TRANSPOSE)*B.
C
C       DELTA IS A POSITIVE INPUT VARIABLE WHICH SPECIFIES AN UPPER
C         BOUND ON THE EUCLIDEAN NORM OF D*X.
C
C       X IS AN OUTPUT ARRAY OF LENGTH N WHICH CONTAINS THE DESIRED
C         CONVEX COMBINATION OF THE GAUSS-NEWTON DIRECTION AND THE
C         SCALED GRADIENT DIRECTION.
C
C       WA1 AND WA2 ARE WORK ARRAYS OF LENGTH N.
