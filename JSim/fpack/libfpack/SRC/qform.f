C     SUBROUTINE QFORM
C
C     THIS SUBROUTINE PROCEEDS FROM THE COMPUTED QR FACTORIZATION OF
C     AN M BY N MATRIX A TO ACCUMULATE THE M BY M ORTHOGONAL MATRIX
C     Q FROM ITS FACTORED FORM.
C
C     THE SUBROUTINE STATEMENT IS
C
C       SUBROUTINE QFORM(M,N,Q,LDQ,WA)
C
C     WHERE
C
C       M IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE SET TO THE NUMBER
C         OF ROWS OF A AND THE ORDER OF Q.
C
C       N IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE SET TO THE NUMBER
C         OF COLUMNS OF A.
C
C       Q IS AN M BY M ARRAY. ON INPUT THE FULL LOWER TRAPEZOID IN
C         THE FIRST MIN(M,N) COLUMNS OF Q CONTAINS THE FACTORED FORM.
C         ON OUTPUT Q HAS BEEN ACCUMULATED INTO A SQUARE MATRIX.
C
C       LDQ IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE NOT LESS THAN M
C         WHICH SPECIFIES THE LEADING DIMENSION OF THE ARRAY Q.
C
C       WA IS A WORK ARRAY OF LENGTH M.
